# Testing a Spade project

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial is aimed at Unix-like systems like macOS, Linux, and WSL.

In this tutorial, we'll setup a Spade project and test our code with
dumbname. You can find the full source code for this tutorial [here](../spade-support/example-project/). We won't touch on the advanced aspects or features; the goal is just to provide a simple overfiew sufficient to get started.

I'll be assuming you've read the [tutorial on testing Verilog projects](./testing_verilog.md); if not, read that first and come back.
